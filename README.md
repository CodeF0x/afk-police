A bot that moves clients to a specified channel when they exceed a given idle time.

I wrote this bot because the one I was using before is buggy as hell. I thought maybe someone else might find this useful. And yes, the code is crap.

#### You need [this great api wrapper](https://github.com/TheHolyWaffle/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API) to get the bot working.
